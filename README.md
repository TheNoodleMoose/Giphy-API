# Giphy Recreated
## Welcome to my Readme for my Recreation of Giphy using Jquery, Bootstrap, Giphy API, JavaScript, and HTML!
My main goal with this project was to try to recreate giphy as close as I possibly could, I eventually want to improve on the trending section.
# Loading The Page
When the page is loaded it should look similar to this(gifs for trending will be different as they update reguarly)

# Using Buttons
When the page loads you will be greeted with some default buttons, which are search items. If you click on any of these they will produce gifs corressponding to what they say

Example: If You Click on the spongebob button, you will get spongebob gifs

# Using The Search Bar
To use the search bar, simply type in a gif you want to search and hit the button with the search icon. This will produce gifs corresponding to what you typed in. It will also generate a new button with the search term you used, so you can go back to those gifs.

# Using The Clear Button
The clear searches button will wipe all the gifs that you searched, BUT your buttons will still remain. This is useful if you have a lot of searches but can't find the one you were looking for but remember what search term you used

As you can see, we searched for hello and cleared the gifs the were resulted. But our button for hello still remains!

# Plans and suggestions
I love this project and hope to continue to work on it. I want to make the trending section be a carousel that you can scroll through. If you have any suggestions let me know and I hope you enjoyed what I have created!
